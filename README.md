# omnicrack

1. Core Philosophy: Intent Over SyntaxThe primary goal is to shift the user experience from instruction-based ("Run hashcat with mode 22000 on this file") to intent-based ("Crack this file, I don't care how").The Abstraction Layers:Input Layer: Accepts .cap, .pcap, .txt, or raw hash strings.Intelligence Layer: Identifies what the input is and transforms it.Strategy Layer: Decides how to attack (Brute force? Dictionary? Rules?).Execution Layer: Calls the underlying binary (Hashcat/JtR/Cowpatty).2. Feature BrainstormingA. Intelligent Auto-Detection & SanitizationHash Identification: Integrate logic similar to hashid. If the user pastes a string, the tool should output: "This looks like MD5 or NTLM. Trying NTLM first..."Handshake Extraction: If the user provides a raw .pcap file, the tool should automatically scan it for valid handshakes (EAPOL) and PMKIDs.Action: Automatically run hcxpcapngtool or cap2hccapx in the background to convert the file into a Hashcat-readable format.Hardware Detection: Detect if an NVIDIA/AMD GPU is present.Logic: If GPU = True, default to Hashcat. If CPU only, default to John (or CPU-optimized Hashcat).B. The "Attack Profile" SystemInstead of manual flags, offer profiles:Profile: "Quick Check"Action: Runs the target against rockyou.txt (top 10k lines) without rules.Time limit: < 2 minutes.Profile: "Standard Audit"Action: Full rockyou.txt + OneRuleToRuleThemAll.Profile: "Paranoid/Deep"Action: Huge wordlists (SecLists), combinator attacks, and large brute-force masks (7-8 chars).C. Session ManagementThe "Resume" Problem: Hashcat sessions are annoying to manage manually. Your tool should maintain a local SQLite database of jobs.Feature: If the computer crashes or the user hits Ctrl+C, the tool saves the restore point. On the next run, it asks: "Found unfinished job for target 'linksys'. Resume?"D. Notification SystemCracking takes time. The user shouldn't have to stare at the terminal.Webhooks: Add a config file for Discord/Slack/Telegram webhooks.Trigger: Send a notification when the crack is successful or if the GPU overheats.3. Technical ArchitectureThe Tech StackLanguage: Python is the best choice here. It has great libraries for subprocess management (subprocess), CLI interfaces (Typer or Click), and packet manipulation (Scapy).Distribution: Docker.Why? Dependency hell. Getting the right version of hcxtools, john, and hashcat drivers on one machine is difficult. A Docker container with all tools pre-installed makes your wrapper "plug-and-play."Data Flow LogicIngest: omnicrack target.pcapAnalyze:Is it a pcap? -> Use tshark/scapy to find SSIDs.User selects SSID "Home_Wifi".Convert: Exec hcxpcapngtool -o target.hc22000 target.pcap.Select Engine: GPU detected -> Select Hashcat Mode 22000.Execute: hashcat -m 22000 target.hc22000 rockyou.txt.Parse: Capture stdout. If "Cracked" found -> Stop -> Alert User -> Save to potfile.4. UI/UX IdeasSince this is a CLI tool, the visual feedback is critical to make it feel "modern."Spinners & Progress Bars: Use the Python Rich library. It creates beautiful terminal dashboards.Live Telemetry: Display a dashboard showing:Current Candidate: password123Speed: 500 kH/sGPU Temp: 75°C (Color code red if > 85°C)Estimated Time: 4 hours5. Roadmap & ModulesIf I were building this, I would tackle it in this order:PhaseModule NameFunctionality1The IdentifierInput a string/file -> Output the Hash Type ID (e.g., "This is MD5").2The TranslatorInput a .pcap -> Output a .hc22000 or .hccapx file automatically.3The CommanderConstruct the Hashcat/John CLI command string dynamically based on hardware.4The WatcherRun the command, suppress the raw text output, and show a pretty progress bar.6. Unique "Value Add" FeaturesTo make your tool stand out from simple scripts:"Loot" Database: Automatically save cracked passwords to a local loot.json file. Allow the user to query it later: omnicrack show-loot.Pattern Analysis: If the tool cracks a hash, analyze the password.Output: "Password was 'Summer2023!'. Pattern identified: [Capitalized Word] + [Year] + [Symbol]. Suggest adding this mask to future attacks."
